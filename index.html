                <li>
                  <b>Status:</b> Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and
                  the smallest planet in the solar system. It has a rocky
                  surface and lacks a significant atmosphere.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Discovery:</b> Known to ancient civilizations, Mercury was

                  <b>Orbit:</b> Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of
                  57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles). It takes 88 Earth
                  days to complete one orbit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Rotation:</b> Mercury has a rotation period of 59 Earth
                  days. Its day is longer than its year, resulting in a day
                  lasting almost twice as long as a year.

                  <b>Atmosphere:</b> Very thin, composed primarily of oxygen,
                  sodium, hydrogen, and helium. The lack of a significant
                  atmosphere means that Mercury experiences extreme temperature
                  fluctuations.

                <li>

                  <b>Status :</b> Once considered the ninth planet of our solar
                  system, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the
                  International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006. Despite its
                  reclassification, Pluto remains an object of significant
                  interest and study.

                  <b>Discovery :</b> Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 at the
                  Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Its discovery was a result of a
                  search for a suspected ninth planet beyond Neptune.

              <b>Orbit and Rotation</b><br />
              <ul class="inside">
                <li>
                  <b>Orbit :</b> Pluto has an elliptical and highly inclined
                  orbit that takes it from 4.4 billion kilometers (2.7 billion
                  miles) to 7.4 billion kilometers (4.6 billion miles) from the
                  Sun. It takes 248 Earth years to complete one orbit around the
                  Sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Rotation :</b> Pluto has a rotation period of about 6.4
                  Earth days. Interestingly, its rotation is retrograde, meaning
                  it spins in the opposite direction to most planets in the
                  solar system.

              <ul class="inside">
                <li>
                  <b>Surface :</b> Composed of a mixture of nitrogen, methane,
                  and carbon monoxide ices. The surface features diverse
                  geological structures, including mountains, valleys, plains,
                  and craters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Atmosphere :</b> Pluto has a thin atmosphere composed
                  primarily of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon
                  monoxide. The atmosphere undergoes seasonal changes, expanding
                  when Pluto is closer to the Sun and freezing onto the surface
                  as it moves farther away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Interior :</b> Believed to have a rocky core surrounded by
                  a mantle of water ice, with the possibility of a subsurface
                  ocean.

                <li>
                  <b>Tombaugh Regio :</b> A large, bright, heart-shaped region
                  on Pluto's surface named in honor of its discoverer. The left
                  lobe of the "heart" is a vast, icy plain known as Sputnik
                  Planitia.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Sputnik Planitia :</b> An enormous glacier made of nitrogen
                  and other exotic ices. This region exhibits evidence of
                  convection cells and possible cryovolcanism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Mountains</b> Pluto has mountain ranges composed of water
                  ice, which behaves like rock at the extremely low temperatures
                  found there. Notable ranges include the Norgay Montes and
                  Hillary Montes.

                <li>
                  <b>Charon :</b> Pluto's largest moon, nearly half its size,
                  forming a binary system with Pluto. Charon's surface is
                  covered with water ice and exhibits a large reddish-brown cap
                  at its north pole, likely composed of tholins.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Other Moons :</b> Pluto has four smaller moons: Styx, Nix,
                  Kerberos, and Hydra. These moons are irregularly shaped and
                  have chaotic orbits due to Pluto and Charon's gravitational
                  influence.

                  <b>New Horizons Mission :</b> NASA's New Horizons spacecraft
                  performed a historic flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015,
                  providing the first close-up images and data of Pluto and its
                  moons. This mission revolutionized our understanding of Pluto,
                  revealing its complex geology and diverse surface features.

                <li>
                  <b>Pluto's Size :</b> Pluto is about 2,377 kilometers (1,477
                  miles) in diameter, making it about 1/6th the width of Earth
                  and smaller than Earth's Moon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Climate and Seasons :</b> Pluto experiences extreme
                  seasonal variations due to its highly elliptical orbit and
                  axial tilt. These changes can cause significant differences in
                  temperature and atmospheric pressure over its long year.

                <li>
                  <b>Historical Debate :</b> The reclassification of Pluto from
                  a planet to a dwarf planet sparked significant public debate
                  and interest, highlighting the evolving nature of scientific
                  understanding and classification.

            Pluto remains a fascinating object of study, offering insights into
            the outer regions of our solar system and the processes that govern
            planetary bodies. Its unique characteristics and the wealth of data
            from the New Horizons mission continue to captivate scientists and
            the public alike.
