            Welcome to our comprehensive guide to the solar system! Dive into
            the fascinating world of our cosmic neighborhood. From the blazing
            Sun at the center to the icy outer reaches, discover detailed
            information about the planets, moons, and other celestial bodies
            that make up our solar system.
            <br /><br />Our solar system is a complex and dynamic system
            consisting of the Sun, eight planets, over 200 moons, and countless
            smaller objects such as asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Each of
            these celestial bodies has its own unique characteristics and
            history, contributing to the diverse tapestry of our cosmic
            surroundings.

            <li>
              Overview : The Heart of Our Solar System Overview: The Sun is a
              G-type main-sequence star (G2V) located at the center of our solar
              system. It is about 4.6 billion years old and is composed
              primarily of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%).
            </li>
            <li>
              Structure :
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Core: The central region where nuclear fusion occurs,
                  converting hydrogen into helium and releasing vast amounts of
                  energy. Radiative Zone: The layer where energy produced in the
                  core moves outward by radiation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Convective Zone: outer layer where energy is transferred by
                  convection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Photosphere: The visible surface of the Sun, where sunspots
                  appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Chromosphere: A layer above the photosphere that is visible
                  during solar eclipses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Corona: The outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere, extending
                  millions of kilometers into space, also visible during
                  eclipses.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Significance: The Sun’s energy drives the climate and weather on
              Earth, and it supports life through photosynthesis.

          <h1>Mercury</h1>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Overview : Mercury is the smallest lilanet in our solar system and
              the closest to the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of 57.9
              million kilometers (36 million miles).
            </li>
            <li>
              Surface: Characterized by its heavily cratered terrain, similar to
              our Moon, with large impact basins such as Caloris Basin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Atmosphere: Extremely thin, composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, and
              hydrogen, making it incapable of supporting life as we know it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Temperature: Experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging
              from -173°C (-280°F) at night to 427°C (800°F) during the day.
            </li>

        <div class="venus">
          <h2>Venus</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Overview: Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often
              referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and
              composition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Surface: Covered with volcanoes, large plains, and mountains, with
              evidence of past volcanic activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Atmosphere: Thick and toxic, composed primarily of carbon dioxide,
              with clouds of sulfuric acid. The greenhouse effect makes it the
              hottest planet, with surface temperatures around 465°C (869°F).
            </li>

            <li>
              Interesting Fact: Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most
              planets in the solar system, meaning it has a retrograde rotation.
